# 👋 Hi, I'm Tim Gerschner

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** currently looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and grow professionally. I enjoy building software solutions and exploring new technologies, and I’m eager to contribute to projects that make a difference.

### 🚀 Current Project
I'm currently working on a mod for **Terraria**. This project is important to me because it allows me to learn C#, expanding my programming skills while pursuing my passion for game development.

### 💼 Professional Background
Although I am currently unemployed and do not have prior professional work experience, I gained hands-on development skills through an immersive program at Dev Academy. This experience simulated real-world development environments and provided me with a solid foundation in full stack development.

### 🛠️ Skills and Tech Stack
- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, HTML5, CSS3, and currently learning C#
- **Frameworks & Tools**: React.js, Node.js, SQLite3, Knex.js, Vitest

### 🔧 Previous Projects
- **[TagHunter](https://taghunter-mako-kotare-2024.pushed.nz/)**: A game inspired by GeoGessr, and gives you the task to hunt and find all the tags that we have stored. If you so choose to log in, you're able to view the gallery for what is avaiable to find!

### 🌱 Learning and Development
I am currently learning how to create items in Terraria that manipulate player character stats, as part of my ongoing mod development.

### 💡 Passion and Interests
My passion is to create games that are fun, immersive, and explore the creativity of the player. I’m driven to craft experiences that bring people together, whether it's a group of friends enjoying a new adventure or an individual diving into the landscapes of their imagination.
